            <img src="../IMAGES/biography_pics/childhood.jpg" alt="Childhood Photo" class="bio-img" id="childhood-img" title="Me and Spongebob!">
            <p>I was born and raised in a family filled with love and life lessons, and I am originally from <strong>Tandang Sora, Quezon City.</strong> In my daily life as a child, I was always full of joy and happiness because during those times, I had no responsibilities to think about or carry. Back then, all I ever thought about was what games I would play throughout the day. I would often find ways to escape the house in the afternoon because I was forced to take naps, as my parents believed that sleeping in the afternoon would help me grow faster. But because I was stubborn and eager to play with my friends, I disobeyed my parents’ instructions to sleep, and I was often punished for it. I was also the kind of child who was always out in the streets because that was where I spent time with other kids who brought me happiness. In games like <b><i>patintero, luksong baka, and tumbang preso,</i></b> I was able to show my agility and my resourceful way of playing. My family taught me how <strong>to be cheerful and how to bring happiness to others.</strong> At a young age, <strong>I learned different ways to bring joy and make my family happy.</strong> And this was the time when <strong>I started realizing that I can do more things.</strong></p>

            <img src="../IMAGES/biography_pics/teenage.jpg" alt="Teenage Photo" class="bio-img" id="teenage-img" title="Consistently achieving High Honors!">
            <p>My teenage years were <strong>full of challenges, changes, and self-reflection.</strong> It was during this time that <strong>I had deep realizations about myself and my plans for the future.</strong> I met many new friends who became my companions in life; <strong>they are an important part of my journey because they shared both the good and bad experiences with me.</strong> I learned <strong>to be more disciplined and to value the things I hold important in life—my time at school, with my family, my friends, and for myself.</strong> When I was in elementary school, I prioritized playing over studying. But in high school, <strong>I focused more on my studies because I saw my potential to become an academic achiever.</strong> And because of my hard work in school, from Grade 9 to Grade 12, <strong>I received the “With High Honors” award consistently.</strong> I am also proud to have graduated from Senior High School as the <strong>Top 1 of our strand.</strong> My teenage years taught me <strong>to become a better person and to keep improving myself.</strong></p>

            <h2 id="college">College Years</h2>
            <img src="../IMAGES/biography_pics/college.png" alt="College Photo" class="bio-img" id="college-img" title="As a 1st Year BSIT Student ">
            <p>My current experience in college as a <strong>2nd year Bachelor of Science in Information Technology student studying at the University of the East - Manila</strong> is one of my biggest stages in life. My responsibilities and time for studying increased because of the many <strong>activities, assignments, quizzes, and exams.</strong> In college, I also realized that I need to be more careful in choosing my circle of friends and who I should work with. Being a college student is extremely stressful because of the many deadlines I have to meet. There are times when I don’t get to sleep because I still need to finish activities with very short deadlines. I realized that <strong>I shouldn’t stay in my comfort zone and that I need to broaden my perspective in the things I do.</strong> Being a college student made me realize that <strong>I am truly growing up.</strong> I can also see myself more clearly on the path I am taking, which is becoming an <b>IT specialist.</b> I believe <strong>I can overcome all of that because I trust in my abilities and in God’s plan.</strong> <i><strong>Padayon!</strong></i></p>
